    <h2>Tony The Terror 'tears' the City Up</h2>
        <div class="scrollable-div">
            <p>
                A man driven over the edge. A mortal-turned force of nature in the face of unbearable anquish. Tony 'The Terror', like all too many members of our city, was a regular man, keeping his head down in the city, until his family was killed by a small time gang. Tony, having lost everything, became a relentless force of retribution.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tony would stalk the gang members, tracking them back to homes and hideouts alike, leaving no member of the men alive. After this, Tony  would attempt to retire, however the city had other plans. In a random act of violence, a nearby shootout with the police would cause Tony's pet dog, the last thing he had from his old life, to catch a stray bullet, and die.
            </p>

            <p>In the wake of this, Tony began to unleash fury upon the city itself. He managed to kill an estimated 127 corrupt police officers and gang members all in all, until  he was finally struck and killed himself, in a planned ambush.</p>
