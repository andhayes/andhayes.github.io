            It was a crisp October morning, and the sea spray from the port town of Empire Port did little to mask the smell of trouble brewing. The townsfolk went about their buisness nervously, as a stranger rode into town, striding confidently with a Colt Single Action Revolver at his hip. Rumours spread quietly, some though him an outlaw, others, a mere vagabond, but one thing was certain, he was trouble.

              If the stranger was looking for trouble, he would indeed find it, in the form of Empire Red, a viscious killer and outlaw, hiding out in the small town. Texas Red racked up a kill count, famously killing 20 men pursuing his bounty, and challenging anyone else who dares to a duel, each one just another notch on his pistol.

              The stranger quickly began speaking to the townsfolk, announcing himself to be a California Ranger, sent to bring in Empire Red, dead or alive. Soon enough this made it's way to Empire Red, who grabbed his pistol and prepared to add another notch. At 11:20, the  pair would meet face to face in the street, and the town watched with baited breath, anxiously awaiting the inevitable death of the charismatic ranger. The men stopped about 40 feet apart, and moved to draw. With a sudden flash and bang, smoke filled the air as Empire Red's head snapped back. The ranger's aim was precise, and his draw like lightning, as his shot landed between Red's eyes before his pistol cleared leather. Thus ended the reign of Empire Red, another day of work for the California Ranger.
