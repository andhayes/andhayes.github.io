            <p>
                Solomon Terrance Howard, AKA Solomon 'Ripper' was a man torn between worlds. On the surface, he was a happy family man, running a small print shop. He had a wife, Theresa Howard, two sons, and a daughter. He spent his life working to do everything he could to provide for his family. Unfortunately for him, the only real work available was mob work.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, desperate for a break, Solomon became a 'Hatchet man' for the mob. The work paid well, but it was brutal, bloody work. Within a year Solomon had taken over 14 life's for the mob. Each of them family men like him, each of them unable to pay their debts to the mob, each of them, completely innocent. As the kills racked up, Solomon began to find more and more enjoyment in the work. Each kill he grew more confident, more violent. With each artistic, grotesque, display of violence, Solomon took more pleasure.
            </p>

            <p>The legend of the 'Man At The Door' grew, as tales began to spread of a brutal sadistic killer clad in a trench coat with a hat hiding his shadowed face and cruel smile. Tales of a mobster who appears in the dead of night, slips into the homes of unsuspecting victims, and leaves a brutally mangled corpse in his wake began to spread. Solomon began to grow paranoid at this, by day, making idle chatter with the other inhabitants of the town about the man at the door, and by night, he continued his bloody crusade against the enemies of the mob. As his paranoia grew, he eventually began practicing in the supernatural, believing he could summon a powerful demon prince to aid him and grant him the power to protect his family.</p>
            
            <p> The killings began to grow more ritualistic, with every new body being savaged still, but no matter their states, every body had one thing in common, they were found missing their right hand. However despite his paranoia, Solomon put on the front of the friendly family man. He would even go as far as to join the night watch formed by the other local families in response to the growing legends.</p>
            
            <p>However, one night, for unknown reasons, Solomon fell into complete mania, killing his family, though this was not discovered until later investigations. After this night, Solomon became a recluse, and cut all ties with the mob. The killings did not stop. The mob put a hit out in response, and that very same night the leader of the mob, as well as his entire family, were killed, all missing their right hand, and the word 'Mortalia' written on the walls. The people of the town began calling this killer 'The Family Man', for his repeated attacks on family households, a morbid name given Solomon's own family.</p>
            
            <p>The next week came to be known as the 'bloody reckoning', with The Family Man killing one whole family each night, with each crime scene the same, every body missing their right hand, often mutilated seemingly for fun, and with the same bloody message 'Mortalia' smeared across the walls. However, the week would come to an end when investigators finally concluded Solomon to be 'The Family Man'. Police would secure Solomon, and investigators discovered the remnants of his family, their bones and blood mixed into ink which he used to write what he believed to be a grimoire to a demon prince. Each page written in the blood of another victim, containing a strange array of symbols.</p>
